# Daily Planner Website (Generation USA Bootcamp Final Project)

A project to build a simple planner for our daily life.

## Purpose

The goal of this final project from the program was to implement what we have learned (both soft and technical skills) since the beginning of the program on building an actual website page.

## Details

Our first task was to created a basic design and features of our final project on wireframe before we actually started to write the code for the website. After we set the basic design for the site, we discussed and worked together to come up with the functional programming approach for our project.

We used bootstrap; CSS3; HTML5; and JavaScript to build our website. It was a good practice for us to implement bootstrap framework and be familiar with it. We learned how to override bootstrap with our own CSS file as well as adding additional custom styles to the website.

## Project Status

In general, we had completed this project. However, we are planning on trying a different programming approach afterward and test it with a mocha unit test suite.
